<p>Passion passio "passion; suffering" (from Latin pati "to suffer"))
is a feeling of intense enthusiasm towards or compelling desire for someone or
something. Passion can range from eager interest in or admiration for an idea,
proposal, or cause; to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity; to
strong attraction, excitement, or emotion towards a person.</p> <p>It is particularly
used in the context of romance or sexual desire, though it generally implies a
deeper or more encompassing emotion than that implied by the term lust.</p>
